## Exercise 1
- Create 4 objects using object literal notation that represent Club Members for a high school robotics club with the following properties
```
name
club role
contact email
contact phone number
```
- Create a function that takes a club member object and prints all of the properties of that club member and use it to print the details of any one club member
- Add all 4 club members to an array called `clubMembers`
- Create a *Club Registry* by looping through the `clubMembers` array and printing each club member's details and the total number of club members
Example Output:

## Exercise 2
- Create 4 objects using object literal notation that represent dogs for a local shelter with the following properties with at *least one dog unavailable*
```
